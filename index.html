                <h2>Spider-man: Hero or Menace?</h2>
                <p>
                    Ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about New York City's so-called "friendly neighborhood Spider-Man." Is he really a hero, as some would like to believe, or a menace lurking in our midst? For years, we've seen this masked vigilante swinging across our skyline, seemingly doing good deeds, but at what cost? We should all be asking ourselves, can we trust someone who hides behind a mask and operates outside the law?            </p>
                <p>
                    The city deserves better than a masked vigilante running amok. We need transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. I call on the authorities to unmask this so-called hero and reveal his true identity. The people have a right to know who is swinging through our streets, meddling in crime-fighting, and perhaps causing more harm than good. Is Spider-Man truly our hero, or is he a menace we should all be wary of? The jury's still out, but one thing is for sure: the citizens of New York deserve the truth.
                </p>
